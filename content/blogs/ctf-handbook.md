> This handbook is a comprehensive compilation of notes and resources from the [d4rkc0de-club/ctf-handbook](https://github.com/d4rkc0de-club/ctf-handbook) GitHub repository, designed for beginners and enthusiasts in the world of Capture The Flag competitions.

## Introduction

### What actually are CTFs ?

A CTF is like a puzzle game for hackers. In simple words, we are given a machine or program which is hackeable
and we get a string that we submit and we get points. The flags are usually in the form of FLAG
{y0u-h4v3-f0und-4-fl4g}.

### How do CTFs work ?

CTFs are of different kinds but the kind that we have to focus on are Jeopardy-style which is solving standalone
challenges from various categories to earn points. The categories include web, pwn, rev, cryto, forensics, osint,
and misc.

#### Scoring In CTF

The scoring can be of two types

1.   Static Scoring
Every challenge has a fixed value based on their defined difficulty. Ex - 100 for easy, 300 for medium and 500 for hard.

2.   Dynamic Scoring
This is the most common type of scoring. Points decrease as more teams solve the challenge.

#### CTFtime

It is the central hub for competitive CTFs. It tracks

*   Upcoming & ongoing CTF events
*   Team rankings
*   CTF writeups and archives
*   Links to scoreboards and challenges

CTF players use this to

*   Plan which competitions to join
*   Track performance
*   View writeups and results

CTFtime Points

*   CTFtime assigns rating point to teams based on their performance in rated CTFs.
*   Only top 10 performances of a team are rated on CTFtime
*   Each CTF is worth up to 100 CTFtime points
*   The rankings reset ever calendar year

## Resources

### Basics

These are the basic things that you need to do if you are going to start cybersecurity. It is important to keep
the basics clear if you want be be good. These basics include :

#### Linux

In cybersecurity, linux is the go-to OS. It gives you control, power and tools that the cybersecurity relies on.
Most of the servers in the world run on linux. You can get started with it in 3 ways.

*   You can use the windows subsystem for linux (WSL) if you are on Windows.
*   You can use virtual machines using softwares like VMware or VirtualBox.
*   If like to take risks, you can just run it bare metal on your device.

#### Practice

*   [pwn.college Linux Luminarium](https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium/)

### Basic Programming

You need to learn basic programming for cybersec but you are not expected to know everything in every language. The best way is to just learn python and then learn others if they align with your domain.

*   **Python** - used for scripting, automation and exploit devlopment. You can learn this from

## Web Exploitation

### Overview

Web exploitation is a category of CTF challenges focused on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web
applications. These simulate real-world attacks like breaking into websites, bypassing logins, stealing data, or
executing unauthorized code. You interact with a target web server through a browser or proxy tools, trying to
find flaws in logic, security controls, or code behavior. In a CTF challenge, you're typically given a live web
app hosted at a URL. Your goal is to inspect and manipulate how the site functions until you can trigger a bug
and retrieve a flag.

## Binary Exploitation

### Overview

Binary Exploitation (often shortened to Binex or pwn) is a category in CTFs that focuses on analyzing and
exploiting compiled programs (binaries) to gain unintended behavior — like leaking information, hijacking control
flow, or executing arbitrary code. The goal is to understand how the program works at a low level (assembly
/memory) and take advantage of flaws in how it handles input, memory, or permissions. This is one of the most
technically deep categories in CTFs, often requiring knowledge of:

*   Assembly language
*   Memory layout (stack, heap, etc.)
*   Calling conventions
*   C/C++ programming
*   Operating system internals You typically receive a binary file (a.out, chall, vuln, etc.) and are told to find a way to make it do something it shouldn’t — like read the flag, spawn a shell, or overwrite memory.

### Learning and Practice

#### [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/)

## Reverse Engineering

### Overview

It is the process of recovering, understanding and reconstructing the design, data structures and algorithms that
were used to build software. In CTFs, generally the objective will be to understand the given material (with a
certain objective in mind) and recover information about the internal workings (often involving a bit of
cryptography too) to eventually find a flag. One example is password verification, you may be presented with a
binary containing an algorithm to check if your password is right, your task would then be to understand what is
being checked, how its being checked, and most probably implement a program to reverse the procedure to get a
suitable solution. The field itself is vast and has many sub-fields that you may focus on, for example : Game
Hacking, Android Hacking, Malware Analysis, Hardware / Firmware Hacking etc.

### Tools

## Cryptography

### Overview

Cryptography challenges in CTFs focus on breaking or analyzing encrypted data. Unlike academic cryptography,
which deals with designing secure systems, CTF crypto challenges usually involve breaking weak implementations,
reversing custom schemes, or recognizing misuse of standard algorithms. You are typically given some encrypted or
encoded data and must figure out a way to decrypt it or extract useful information like a flag.

### Learning and Practice

*   [Cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/)
*   [Sagemath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
*   [dCode](https://www.dcode.fr/)

## Forensics

### Overview

Forensics in CTFs is all about analyzing digital artifacts to uncover hidden information, recover deleted
content, or trace suspicious activity. The challenges simulate real-world digital investigations, like digging
through disk images, network traffic, memory dumps, or suspicious files. Unlike other CTF categories that may
involve breaking code or exploiting vulnerabilities, forensics focuses more on extracting and interpreting data
that’s already present, sometimes hidden, obfuscated, or buried in metadata.

### Tools

*   strings
*   binwalk
*   exiftool
*   steghide
*   Wireshark
*   CyberChef

### Learning and Practice

*   Hack the Box
*   TryHackMe
*   picoCTF
*   CTFlearn
*   Root Me

## Miscellaneous

### Overview

Miscellaneous (misc) is a catch-all category in Capture The Flag competitions. It includes challenges that don’t
clearly fit into other categories like pwn, web, crypto, or forensics. These problems often test creativity,
outside-the-box thinking, real-world knowledge, or specialized tools. Because it’s broad, misc challenges vary a
 lot, but they're often among the most fun and diverse problems in a CTF.

### Tools

*   Cyberchef
*   sherlock
*   archive.org
*   LLMs (especially ChatGPT)
*   Social Media Sites
*   Search Engines (google dorking)

### Learning and Practice

*   For OSINT , you can practice on [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/)
*   Learning and practice of this type is usually done by just participating in CTFs.

## Most Important Note

The real learning begins when you get your hands dirty. Don’t wait until you feel “ready”. Just jump into CTFs
and start solving! Even if you struggle or don’t score well at first, every challenge teaches you something
valuable. The best way to grow in cybersecurity is to keep showing up, keep practicing, and never stop learning.
Progress might feel slow at times, but if you stay consistent, you'll be amazed at how far you go. Also try to
read writeups of challenges in your free time. Everyone starts somewhere. JUST START.
